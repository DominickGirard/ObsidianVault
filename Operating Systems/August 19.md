Interrupt is an electrical signal sent from computer comment to operating system

This informs the OS that the computer finished the task or if they have an error 

### Interrupt Vs Trap 

They are both Interrupts bur trap is from software

Interrupt can come from any computer resource but if it comes from software we call it Trap

They have their own identification number so OS knows how to handle the error

#### Why do we name the signal issues by a resource an **interrupt**?

Its so we stop any task the CPU is running and work on this task/remedy.


Below is the process of the Interrupt signal

so each square is counting by two bytes in this case 
so we get 12 and 16 for cell address.

registers are memory cells in the CPU.

To put numbers  into register R2

load(Cell address), slot;

Those commands can be converted to Binary

#### The three steps of the Machine cycle 
1. Fetch 
2. Decode 
3. Execute
